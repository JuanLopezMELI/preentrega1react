# Kafe

This is a project that emulates a clothing store.
It is implemented completely in React and uses Vite as a build tool.
It makes use of the Context API to manage the state of the application, and uses the React Router to manage the routes.

As the application is only for testing purposes, the keys of firebase are hardcoded in the code, so it is not necessary to create a .env file. You just need to clone the application and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

To run locally, run `npm run dev`

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, this project is using the following plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
